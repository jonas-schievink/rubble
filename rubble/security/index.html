<p>The Security Manager is a mandatory part of BLE and is connected to L2CAP channel <code>0x0006</code> when
the Link-Layer connection is established.</p>
<h1 id="ble-security" class="section-header"><a href="#ble-security">BLE Security</a></h1>
<p>As is tradition, BLE security is a complexity nightmare. This section hopes to clear up a few
things and tries to define terms used throughout the code and specficiation.</p>
<h2 id="pairing-and-bonding" class="section-header"><a href="#pairing-and-bonding">Pairing and Bonding</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pairing</strong> is the process of generating and exchanging connection-specific keys in order to
accomplish an encrypted Link-Layer connection.</p>
<p>This is done by having the <em>Security Managers</em> of the devices talk to each other to perform
the key exchange, and then using <em>LL Control PDUs</em> to enable the negotiated encryption
parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bonding</strong> means permanently storing the shared keys derived by <em>Pairing</em> in order to reuse
them for later connections.</p>
<p>The way keys are stored is inherently platform- and application-dependent, we just have to
provide interfaces to export and import key sets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most times, when talking about <em>pairing</em>, the <em>bonding</em> part is implied. If it were not, you
would constantly have to re-pair devices when reconnecting them.</p>
<h2 id="le-legacy-pairing-vs-le-secure-connections" class="section-header"><a href="#le-legacy-pairing-vs-le-secure-connections">LE Legacy Pairing vs. LE Secure Connections</a></h2>
<p>Bluetooth's security track record is an actual record in that it is so atrociously bad that this
protocol should have never seen the light of the day. Alas, here we are.</p>
<p>LE security is generally able to utilize <em>AES-128-CCM</em> for encryption, which isn't broken by
itself (unlike the &quot;export-grade&quot; encryption used by earlier Bluetooth versions). However, the
way the AES key is exchanged differs between <em>LE Legacy Pairing</em> and <em>LE Secure Connections</em>
pairing, which hugely impacts actual security.</p>
<h3 id="le-legacy-pairing" class="section-header"><a href="#le-legacy-pairing">LE Legacy Pairing</a></h3>
<p>For BLE 4.0 and 4.1, only the <em>LE Legacy Pairing</em> (as it is now known as) was available. Like
every awfully designed protocol, they've rolled their own crypto and use their own key exchange
procedure (with the usual catastrophic consequences). First, a shared 128-bit <strong>T</strong>emporary
<strong>K</strong>ey (TK) is obtained, which is then used to generate the 128-bit <strong>S</strong>hort-<strong>T</strong>erm <strong>K</strong>ey
(STK) that is used to initially encrypt the connection while other keys are exchanged.</p>
<p>The STK is generated from the TK by mixing in random values from master (<code>Mrand</code>) and slave
(<code>Srand</code>), which are exchanged in plain text. If a passive eavesdropper manages to obtain TK,
they only need to listen for the <code>Mrand</code> and <code>Srand</code> value and can then compute the STK and
decrypt the connection.</p>
<p>There are 3 methods of determining the TK:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Just Works&quot;</em>: TK=0</li>
<li><em>Passkey Entry</em>: A 6-digit number is displayed on one device and input on the other device.
The number is directly used as the TK (after zero-padding it to 128 bits).</li>
<li><em>Out-of-Band</em> (OOB): The 128-bit TK is provided by an external mechanism (eg. NFC).</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Just Works&quot; obviously is broken without any effort other than listening for the exchanged
<code>Mrand</code> and <code>Srand</code> values.</p>
<p>The Passkey Entry method only allows 1000000 different TKs (equivalent to using 20-bit keys)
and does not do any key derivation. This makes it trivial to brute-force the TK by running the
STK derivation up to a million times.</p>
<p><strong>The only way to perform <em>LE Legacy Pairing</em> with meaningful protection against passive
eavesdropping is by using a secure Out-of-Band channel for agreeing on the TK.</strong></p>
<h3 id="le-secure-connections-pairing" class="section-header"><a href="#le-secure-connections-pairing">LE Secure Connections pairing</a></h3>
<p>Added with BLE 4.2, this finally uses established cryptography to do everything. It uses ECDH on
the P-256 curve (aka &quot;secp256r1&quot; or &quot;prime256v1&quot;).</p>
<p>Using ECDH immediately protects against passive eavesdropping. MITM-protection works similarly
to what <em>LE Legacy Pairing</em> attempted to do, but is actually relevant here since the base key
exchange isn't broken to begin with. There are several user confirmation processes that can
offer MITM-protection:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Just Works&quot;</em>: No MITM-protection. Uses the <em>Numeric Comparison</em> protocol internally, with
automatic confirmation.</li>
<li><em>Numeric Comparison</em>: Both devices display a 6-digit confirmation value and the user is
required to compare them and confirm on each device if they're equal.</li>
<li><em>Passkey Entry</em>: Either a generated passkey is displayed on one device and input on the other,
or the user inputs the same passkey into both devices.</li>
<li><em>Out-of-Band</em> (OOB): An Out-of-Band mechanism is used to exchange random nonces and confirm
values. The mechanism has to be secure against MITM.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="le-privacy" class="section-header"><a href="#le-privacy">LE Privacy</a></h2>
<p>BLE devices are normally extremely easy to track. Since many people use BLE devices, and device
addresses are device-unique, they can be very easily used to identify and track people just by
recording BLE advertisements.</p>
<p>The LE privacy feature can prevent this by changing the device address over time. Bonded devices
can still <em>resolve</em> this address by using a shared <strong>I</strong>dentity <strong>R</strong>esolving <strong>K</strong>ey (IRK).</p>
<p>This feature is not related to encryption or authentication of connections.</p>
