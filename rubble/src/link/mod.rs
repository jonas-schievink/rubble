//! Link-Layer.
//!
//! Note that a hardware BLE radio will already implement a few aspects of the link layer (such as
//! CRC calculation, preamble generation, etc.). Consider this module to be a construction kit for
//! BLE Link-Layers: Take whatever your hardware can do, supplement it with a few condiments from
//! this module, and you get a (hopefully) working Link-Layer.
//!
//! Refer to the official *Link Layer Specification* for details and more graphics and tables.
//!
//! # Packet Format
//!
//! All following graphics are based on the Bluetooth specification. If a field is marked with `-`,
//! it should be set to 0 when sending such a packet, and ignored when receiving it (the spec calls
//! these "RFU" = Reserved for Future Use).
//!
//! All values are transmitted in little-endian bit order unless otherwise noted. All fields in
//! graphics are ordered starting with the field transmitted first (LSB).
//!
//! The following graphic illustrates the raw in-air packet format. The packet transfers a PDU whose
//! format depends on whether it is sent on an *advertising channel* or a *data channel*.
//!
//! ```notrust
//! LSB                                                     MSB
//! +-----------+----------------+---------------+------------+
//! | Preamble  | Access Address |     PDU       |  CRC       |
//! | (1 octet) | (4 octets)     | (2-39 octets) | (3 octets) |
//! +-----------+----------------+---------------+------------+
//!                              \---------------/      ^
//!                                      |              |
//!                                      +--------------+
//!                                     CRC is calculated
//!                                       over the PDU
//!
//!                              \----------------------------/
//!                                    Data Whitening is
//!                                 applied to PDU and CRC
//! ```
//!
//! The 24-bit CRC value is transmitted MSb first. Length of the PDU depends on the kind of PDU
//! (advertising or data channel).
//!
//! ## Advertising Channel PDU
//!
//! Each advertising channel PDU consists of a 16-bit header and a variably-sized payload, the
//! length of which is stored in a header field.
//!
//! ```notrust
//! LSB                                           MSB
//! +-------------+---------------------------------+
//! |  Header     |             Payload             |
//! |  (16 bits)  |    (length stored in header)    |
//! +-------------+---------------------------------+
//! ```
//!
//! The header looks like this:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! LSB                                                                     MSB
//! +------------+------------+---------+---------+--------------+------------+
//! |  PDU Type  |     -      |  TxAdd  |  RxAdd  |    Length    |     -      |
//! |  (4 bits)  |  (2 bits)  | (1 bit) | (1 bit) |   (6 bits)   |  (2 bits)  |
//! +------------+------------+---------+---------+--------------+------------+
//! ```
//!
//! The `TxAdd` and `RxAdd` field are only used for some payloads, for all others, they should be
//! set to 0.
//!
//! Length may be in range 6 to 36 (inclusive).
//!
//! The data in `Payload` depends on the PDU Type. Refer to the spec or [`advertising::PduType`] for
//! details.
//!
//! [`advertising::PduType`]: advertising/enum.PduType.html
//!
//! ## Data Channel PDU
//!
//! A data channel PDU also contains a 16-bit header (but with a different layout) and a
//! variably-sized payload.
//!
//! If the connection is encrypted and the payload contains at least 1 octet, a Message Integrity
//! Check (MIC) is appended at the end.
//!
//! ```notrust
//! LSB                                          MSB
//! +-----------+----------------------+ - - - - - +
//! |  Header   |        Payload       |    MIC    |
//! | (16 bits) |    (0..=27 octets)   | (32 bits) |
//! +-----------+----------------------+ - - - - - +
//! ```
//!
//! Layout (in Bluetooth 4.2):
//!
//! ```notrust
//! LSB                                                                MSB
//! +----------+---------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+
//! |   LLID   |  NESN   |   SN    |   MD    |     -      |    Length    |
//! | (2 bits) | (1 bit) | (1 bit) | (1 bit) |  (3 bits)  |   (8 bits)   |
//! +----------+---------+---------+---------+------------+--------------+
//! ```
//!
//! Payload format depends on the value of the 2-bit `LLID` field:
//!
//! * `0b00`: Reserved value.
//! * `0b01`: LL Data PDU Continuation fragment or empty PDU.
//! * `0b10`: LL Data PDU Start of L2CAP message (or complete message if no fragmentation
//!   necessary).
//! * `0b11`: LL Control PDU.
//!
//! The `NESN` field specifies the **N**ext **E**xpected **S**equence **N**umber. The `SN` field
//! specifies the **S**equence **N**umber of this PDU.
//!
//! The `MD` field specifies that the device sending the packet has more data to send during this
//! *connection event*. When both slave and master send a packet with the `MD` bit set to 0, the
//! connection event ends.
//!
//! The `Length` field specifies the length of payload **and `MIC`**. For Bluetooth versions <4.2,
//! its maximum value is 31, resulting in a 27 octet Payload (the maximum) and a 32-bit `MIC`. 4.2
//! added the possibility of larger packets.
